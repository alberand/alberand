### Hey 👋

I'm Andrey, I do embedded stuff and exploring system programming.

I have experience with:
* I'm full time 🐧 Linux user. I'm learning daily new aspects of the kernel and how it works. I'm mainly intrested in Real-Time behaviour of the kernel.
* I'm learning Zephyr. It's just amazing
* I do embedded devices 📟 (some more intresting stuff is coming 😉)
* I have a few ongoing personal embedded projects

I have a blog at [alberand.com](https://alberand.com)
